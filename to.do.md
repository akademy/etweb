# Todo List
- Add start and end values to audio detection
- should be able to search Species by type (bird, insect, etc)
- Index everything
- Include a model to hold a dataset? And piece of data? Could reference it in Analysis and Detection

# Future
- Should be able to search Species by Position, and groups of positions (or areas). But only one currently.
	- Perhaps a screen to select multiple positions, that then is persistent across all other screens.
- Include historical weather
	- (Weather data is collected at the ET Site).
- Pagination
	- Pages are restricted to 1000 returns. No next or previous.
- Work out timezone from Position. Currently it is assumed "Europe/London"

## Done
- ~~Add a "process" element, (that is really does the detection), at a basic level, AI or human~~
- ~~Implement all models~~
- ~~Added added and modified dates~~
- ~~About page~~
	- ~~Add a description to each page of the models, explaining what they are.~~
	- ~~Also add a longer description on the about page~~
- ~~Pull data from WikiData~~
- ~~Position should show list of detectors~~
- ~~Bring table Javascript into one file~~

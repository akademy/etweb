# Todo List
- Add start and end values to audio detection
- About page
- Implement all models (Position etc.)
- should be able to search Species by type (bird, insect, etc)
- Index everything
- Pull data from WikiData

# Future
- Should be able to search Species by Position! When there's more than one, if ever...!)

## Done
- ~~Add a "process" element, (that is really does the detection), at a basic level, AI or human~~
